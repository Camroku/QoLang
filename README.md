# QoLang version 0.1
The Qo Programming Language, or QoLang.

The project was inspired from [Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter.](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) article series.

## Installation
You need `make` and `pyinstaller`.

Run this command as root:
```
make clean build install
```

To uninstall, run this command as root:

```

A custom installer will be made in the future, with Windows support.
